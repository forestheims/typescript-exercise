# TypeScript annotation

This is an exercise repository for practicing the use and creation of types in a
TypeScript file. `annotate-me.ts` stands as the file intended to be modified.

All submissions should be able to pass `npm test`, which you can test locally
before submitting your work. In addition, `npm test` will run on the GitHub
actions for this project. `npm test` simply runs `tsc`, which will check your
types for you.

## Rubric

1. Annotate local variables, function parameters, and function return types. (8)
2. Tolerate `null` as a possible value where it can arise. (6)
3. Annotate the discriminated union. (6)
